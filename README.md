# Semester Plan
For the semester, we plan on focusing on creating an app that simply provides users with company input deals and promotions in their local area.  
The minimum viable product is an app that allows a user to select a location and determine what local deals or promotions are available.  

# Architecture
Plan is to have an app interface (react native) that reads a database (tbd) and uses Google Maps API to search the database.  

# User Stories
